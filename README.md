# Dart Getter VSCode Extension

This is the README for the "dart-getter" extension, which provides functionality related to generating Dart getter methods.

## Features

The "dart-getter" extension allows you to generate getter methods in Dart classes quickly and easily. Simply select the class you want to generate getters for, choose the type of getter you want to create, and let the extension handle the rest.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

![Command Menu](./screenshots/main_menu.png)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.


When you run Command+Shift + P, there will be 2 options
![Two Option Menus](./screenshots/two_option_menus.png)

## Direct Getter

Generate a direct getter extension for the selected Dart class.
